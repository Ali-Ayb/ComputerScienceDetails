    <h1>Definition:</h1>
    <p class="Definition">Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field
        which includes
        everything
        from
        the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed
        and
        designed.Computer Science has many fields.</p>
